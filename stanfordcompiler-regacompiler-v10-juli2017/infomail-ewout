Hey,

I've finished a first analysis of v10 of our algorithm.
The test was done using our compiler vs the Stanford compiler.

In attachment, you can find a tar file which contains the following files:
The following three fasta files contain the sequences that were different in result between Rega and Stanford compiler
IN-problematic.fasta
PR-problematic.fasta
RT-problematic.fasta
The following three html files show the differences between the problematic sequences
IN.v1000.diff.html
PR.v1000.diff.html
RT.v1000.diff.html
The following three text files contain the id's of the sequences that were considered problematic
sequenceids.IN.txt
sequenceids.PR.txt
sequenceids.RT.txt

I'll give a short summary:
IN: 1 sequence was different between the two compilers (out of 11763 sequences)
PR: 1332 sequences were different between the two compilers (out of 103706 sequences)
RT: 171 sequences were different between the two compilers (out of 111184 sequences)

I think the next step will be to figure out why those sequences are different and list those remarks in a document
